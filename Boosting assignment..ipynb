    "Ans: Gradient Boosting Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification problems. It is an ensemble learning method where multiple weak models are combined to form a stronger model. The algorithm starts by fitting a simple model to the data and then adding subsequent models, each one attempting to correct for the errors of the previous model."
